  <small>Texto XS en escala SMALLER: But a rock of all sizes and shapes, fragments of all sizes and shapes, and even colors that have grown together to become a cohesive rock outlasting the nature of Space, sort of living together in a very coherent, very peaceful manner. When we return this rock or some of the others like it to Houston, we'd like to share a piece of this rock with so many of the countries throughout the world. We hope that this will be a symbol of what our feelings are, what the feelings of the Apollo Program are, and a symbol of mankind that we can live in peace and harmony in the future.</small>

  Este es un párrafo: We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.

  Este es otro párrafo: The most significant things we can think about, when we think about Apollo, is that it has opened for us, for us being the World, a challenge of the future. The door is now cracked, but the promise of that future lies in the young people, not just in America, but the young people all over the world.

  <small>Este es un párrafo pequeño: Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. The simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed daily. Nothing we did had any shelf life. Not one of us stood up and said, ‘Dammit, stop!’ I don’t know what Thompson’s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find.</small>
